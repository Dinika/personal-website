        </div>
        <p>
            I am a software engineer, specialized in full-stack web development. Currently, I am working at CERN with a group of really smart engineers,
            managers, and physicists to develop services, applications, and APIs that are used for managing and smoothly opertating the LHC.
            It is truly a humbling experience.

            <h4>What kind of work do I enjoy?</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            I like spending time on improving the quality of engineering systems. I am always eager to improve and develop my teamâ€™s ability to provide reliable, high available software by using priciples of <span class="highlight">automated testing</span> and <span class="highlight">CI/CD</span>.

            I like working in autonomous teams. I find <span class="highlight">pair-programming</span> and code-reviews fun and extremely helpful.

            Finally, I like it when I have the opportunity to get <span class="highlight">involved in all stacks of feature development</span> - from user-requirements gathering, to architecture design, backend / frontend development, code-deployment, and finally assessing user-reactions. Not only is it a gratifying experience to be in touch with our users needs, I belive, it also helps me deliver better engineering solutions.

            <h4>What do I like to do in my free time?</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            I love playing with my dog - Sudo, dancing to hip-hop songs, playing FitXR on the oculus, listening to songs, walking around lakes and in parks, taking naps, eating noodles, learning about VR, and pair-programming with my friends on open-sourced projects.
